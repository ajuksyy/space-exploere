    id: "1",
    fact: "The Milky Way galaxy contains over 100 billion stars, and our Sun is just one of them. It would take you 100,000 years to travel across the galaxy at the speed of light!"
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    fact: "A day on Venus is longer than its year! Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once, but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus."
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    fact: "Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. It's so large that three Earths could fit inside it, and winds can reach speeds of up to 432 km/h (268 mph)."
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    fact: "Neptune has the fastest winds in our solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). That's nearly supersonic! These winds are driven by the planet's internal heat rather than solar energy."
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    fact: "Saturn's moon Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere. It's the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere, and it even has lakes and rivers made of liquid methane!"
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    fact: "The Sun contains 99.86% of the solar system's mass. Every second, it converts about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy in the process."
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    fact: "Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system - Olympus Mons. It's about 22 km (13.6 miles) high, which is nearly three times taller than Mount Everest. It's also about the size of the state of Arizona!"
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    fact: "Uranus rotates on its side at a 98-degree angle, likely caused by a massive collision billions of years ago. This gives it extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness."
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    fact: "The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains millions of rocky objects, but they're spread so far apart that a spacecraft can easily pass through without hitting anything. The total mass of all asteroids is less than that of Earth's Moon."
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    fact: "A neutron star is so dense that a teaspoon of its material would weigh about 6 billion tons on Earth. These stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars that exploded as supernovae."
  },
  {
    id: "11",
    fact: "The Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest major galactic neighbor, located about 2.5 million light-years away. It's heading toward the Milky Way at 110 km/s and will collide with us in about 4.5 billion years!"
  },
  {
    id: "12",
    fact: "Mercury experiences the most extreme temperature variations in the solar system, ranging from -173°C (-280°F) at night to 427°C (800°F) during the day. This 600°C difference is due to its lack of atmosphere."
  },
  {
    id: "13",
    fact: "Pluto takes 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun once. Since its discovery in 1930, it hasn't even completed one full orbit yet! It will complete its first orbit since discovery in the year 2178."
  },
  {
    id: "14",
    fact: "The International Space Station travels at about 28,000 km/h (17,500 mph), completing an orbit around Earth every 90 minutes. Astronauts on board see 16 sunrises and sunsets every day!"
  },
  {
    id: "15",
    fact: "Black holes aren't actually holes - they're regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. The boundary around a black hole is called the event horizon."
  },
  {
    id: "16",
    fact: "Jupiter acts as a cosmic vacuum cleaner, protecting inner planets from asteroids and comets. Its massive gravity either captures these objects or flings them out of the solar system, preventing many potential impacts on Earth."
  },
  {
    id: "17",
    fact: "The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) per year. This means that in the distant past, the Moon appeared much larger in the sky, and days on Earth were shorter."
  },
  {
    id: "18",
    fact: "Saturn's rings are incredibly thin - only about 10 meters (30 feet) thick in most places, despite being 175,000 miles wide. They're made of billions of ice particles and rocky debris ranging from tiny grains to house-sized chunks."
  },
  {
    id: "19",
    fact: "There are more stars in the observable universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. Scientists estimate there are about 10^22 to 10^24 stars, while there are roughly 7.5 × 10^18 grains of sand on Earth."
  },
  {
    id: "20",
    fact: "The Oort Cloud is a theoretical spherical cloud of icy objects surrounding our solar system at distances up to 100,000 astronomical units from the Sun. It's thought to be the source of long-period comets that occasionally visit the inner solar system."
  },
  {
    id: "21",
    fact: "Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, has a subsurface ocean that may contain twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans combined. Scientists believe this ocean could potentially harbor life, making Europa a prime target for future exploration."
  },
  {
    id: "22",
    fact: "A light-year is the distance light travels in one year - about 9.46 trillion kilometers (5.88 trillion miles). The nearest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri, is about 4.24 light-years away."
  },
  {
    id: "23",
    fact: "The Sun is so massive that it accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of our solar system. If you could fit all the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets together, they would still be less than 0.2% of the solar system's total mass."
  },
  {
    id: "24",
    fact: "Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids. Phobos orbits so close to Mars that it appears to rise in the west and set in the east, and it's gradually spiraling inward, eventually to crash into the planet."
  },
  {
    id: "25",
    fact: "The temperature at the Sun's core is about 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit). This incredible heat and pressure is what allows nuclear fusion to occur, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing energy."
  },
  {
    id: "26",
    fact: "Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon, is bigger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system known to have its own magnetic field. It's also thought to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust."
  },
  {
    id: "27",
    fact: "The Kuiper Belt, located beyond Neptune, contains thousands of icy objects including dwarf planets like Pluto. It's similar to the asteroid belt but much larger - about 20 times wider and 20 to 200 times more massive."
  },
  {
    id: "28",
    fact: "A day on Mercury lasts 59 Earth days, but a year on Mercury (one orbit around the Sun) takes only 88 Earth days. This means a day on Mercury is longer than its year!"
  },
  {
    id: "29",
    fact: "The Hubble Space Telescope can see objects that are billions of light-years away, allowing us to look back in time. When we observe a galaxy 10 billion light-years away, we're seeing it as it was 10 billion years ago!"
  },
  {
    id: "30",
    fact: "Earth is the only known planet in the universe with life, but scientists estimate there could be billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy alone. The search for extraterrestrial life continues with missions to Mars, Europa, and beyond."
